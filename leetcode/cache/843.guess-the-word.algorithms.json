One word of <code>words</code> was chosen as a secret word.</p>\n\n<p>You are also given the helper object <code>Master</code>. You may call <code>Master.guess(word)</code> where <code>word</code> is a six-letter-long string, and it must be from <code>words</code>. <code>Master.guess(word)</code> returns:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>-1</code> if <code>word</code> is not from <code>words</code>, or</li>\n\t<li>an integer representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the secret word.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There is a parameter <code>allowedGuesses</code> for each test case where <code>allowedGuesses</code> is the maximum number of times you can call <code>Master.guess(word)</code>.</p>\n\n<p>For each test case, you should call <code>Master.guess</code> with the secret word without exceeding the maximum number of allowed guesses. You will get:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong><code>&quot;Either you took too many guesses, or you did not find the secret word.&quot;</code></strong> if you called <code>Master.guess</code> more than <code>allowedGuesses</code> times or if you did not call <code>Master.guess</code> with the secret word, or</li>\n\t<li><strong><code>&quot;You guessed the secret word correctly.&quot;</code></strong> if you called <code>Master.guess</code> with the secret word with the number of calls to <code>Master.guess</code> less than or equal to <code>allowedGuesses</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The test cases are generated such that you can guess the secret word with a reasonable strategy (other than using the bruteforce method).</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> secret = &quot;acckzz&quot;, words = [&quot;acckzz&quot;,&quot;ccbazz&quot;,&quot;eiowzz&quot;,&quot;abcczz&quot;], allowedGuesses = 10\n<strong>Output:</strong> You guessed the secret word correctly.\n<strong>Explanation:</strong>\nmaster.guess(&quot;aaaaaa&quot;) returns -1, because &quot;aaaaaa&quot; is not in wordlist.\nmaster.guess(&quot;acckzz&quot;) returns 6, because &quot;acckzz&quot; is secret and has all 6 matches.\nmaster.guess(&quot;ccbazz&quot;) returns 3, because &quot;ccbazz&quot; has 3 matches.\nmaster.guess(&quot;eiowzz&quot;) returns 2, because &quot;eiowzz&quot; has 2 matches.\nmaster.guess(&quot;abcczz&quot;) returns 4, because &quot;abcczz&quot; has 4 matches.\nWe made 5 calls to master.guess, and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> secret = &quot;hamada&quot;, words = [&quot;hamada&quot;,&quot;khaled&quot;], allowedGuesses = 10\n<strong>Output:</strong> You guessed the secret word correctly.\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since there are two words, you can guess both.\n</pre>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>1 &lt;= words.length &lt;= 100</code></li>\n\t<li><code>words[i].length ==
